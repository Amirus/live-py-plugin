live-py-plugin
==============

Live coding in Python implemented as an Eclipse plug in.

Working:
- local variable assignments
- looping
- function calls, and multiple calls.
- compile errors
- runtime exceptions
- infinite loops halted.

Bugs:
- line numbers are funky for some exceptions.

To do:
- Any error currently blanks out the results, should just show previous result
with error marker.
- Figure out how to scroll horizontally.
- Move ruler to right side.
